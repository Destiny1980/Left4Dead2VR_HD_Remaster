Cheat engine for VR Companion


So you want to pop the screen smaller with a button like with Vorpx for menus?

right, similar to how vorpx swaps from wrap. 

no platform I use has size presets. virtual desktop, superdepth3d, (havent bought helix but I will now)
all require some manual sizing, by stretching or swapping to the main menu of the app and the holding down an arrow key for a while. 

I could build an ahk script to manage that process with vr controllers in mind

Helixvision doesnt have that from what I remember but it is a handy feature for Vorpx. It would need to be done by whoever made the wrapper but I guess the only thing you could do it manually move the screen back and forth when you need to but thats not ideal

so superdepth3d vr companion is 99% there. his code is great and I love it. But I talked to blueskydefender and he has no config file for it. I actually find his app to be the best of all, but no config, so Im doing the take-off-headset-press-arrow-keys which isnt ideal for the user, takes a good 60 seconds if I want to nav any menu

That should be super easy to do, yeah. I think you did mention Cheat Engine before, but yeah, Cheat Engine makes it really easy to do things like that too (but ideally, you'd make it into the app)

you actually told me about cheat engine for cams or in this case, for menus. 

I have built taables before but tried to use it for the companion app yesterday, it didnt pick up using (increased value) (unchanged value)
if thats not how you would use cheat engine to accomplish, let me know

Oh yeah, that's odd it didn't pick up, it should have. Maybe it was a different int type?

compaanion hasa a laauncher that accepts key strokes then the actual viewer, then the actual game that is being displayed on the HMD, so I need to do more testing
I wouldnt rule it out as a possibility
just wanted to make sure that was what you were referring to as a method
once cheat engine is configed with scripts, it coudl work in tandem with auto hot key, and ahk has github scripts for all vr controllers, I could easily have right thumbstick click set as "activate cheat engine script" which swaps between head wrap sbs and flat 2d
